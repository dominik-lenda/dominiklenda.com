## About me
![oddly cut photo](/img/face.png)

Hello, I am a psychological researcher and a cloud engineer. Iâ€™ve got MA in Psychology from SWPS University in Wroclaw, Poland. Since the beginning of my studies, my main occupation has been programming and data analysis in R. Lately, I am the principal investigator in the grant project on experience-based decision making. 

However, the lack of systematic approaches in the development of psychological theories and other problems in psychological science, such as shaky foundations of many statistical conclusions, forced me to rethink my profession. Therefore, I'm changing my job to a cloud engineer to apply my passion for programming and solve real-world problems.
