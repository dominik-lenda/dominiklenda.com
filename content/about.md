Hello, I am a psychologist with a background in experimental psychology. Iâ€™ve got MA in Psychology from SWPS University in Wroclaw, Poland. However, since the beginning of my studies, my main occupation was programming and data analysis in R. Lately, I am the principal investigator in the grant project on experience-based decision making.

Psychology suffers from [theoretical amnesia](http://osc.centerforopenscience.org/2013/11/20/theoretical-amnesia/), i.e., it lacks theoretical, preferably formalized appeal. That's why currently I'm interested in the role of theory in psychology and its related fields such as cognitive science. In the future, I'd like to work on formalization in psychology, regardless of its form: computational, logical, axiomatic. 

Besides that, I enjoy skateboarding, programming, and [viming](https://www.vim.org/about.php). Recently, I've been exploring the beauty of functional programming languages such as Elm or Haskell. In the meantime, I dig into the nuts and bolts of web development, especially frontend development.
